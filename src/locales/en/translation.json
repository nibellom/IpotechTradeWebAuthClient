This User Agreement (hereinafter — “Agreement”) governs access and use of the IpotechTrade (iTrade) trading bot, available at itrade.studio and via Telegram bot @IpotechTradeBot.\n1.2. Using the Service constitutes unconditional acceptance of this Agreement.\n1.3. This Agreement is a public offer in accordance with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. Acceptance of the offer is deemed complete upon User registration on the website or in the Telegram bot.\n\n2.

Subject of the Agreement\n3.1. The Administrator (IE Garin A.A.) grants the User access to the IpotechTrade (iTrade) trading bot for automated crypto-trading on supported exchanges.\n3.2. IpotechTrade is not a broker, dealer, financial advisor, or licensed investment platform. The Service does not provide investment, legal, tax, or financial advice.\n\n4. Deposit and Connection\n4.1. To start, the User must register on the website or in Telegram and connect their exchange account (Bybit, Binance, etc.) by entering API keys.\n4.2. Upon registration, the User receives a welcome deposit of 50 USDT (100 USDT if registered via a referral link). The welcome deposit cannot be withdrawn.\n4.3. Deposit top-ups occur in two stages:\n• The User selects “Top up deposit” and specifies the desired amount.\n• Within 2 hours, the User must transfer the equivalent USDT amount to the Bot’s specified Bybit UID.\n4.4. If no transfer is made within 2 hours, the payment request is canceled.\n4.5. Deposits must remain positive. If a User’s deposit becomes negative, trading is suspended until it is replenished.\n\n5. Referral Program\n5.1. Each User may participate in the referral program and receive 20% of deposits made by referred users (excluding welcome bonuses).\n5.2. Referred users receive a 100 USDT welcome deposit instead of 50 USDT.\n5.3. Referral rewards are paid in USDT to the User’s Bybit UID specified in the Service.\n\n6. Fees and Payments\n6.1.

The User agrees to:\n• provide accurate registration data;\n• not disclose account credentials;\n• when creating API keys, not allow asset withdrawals and whitelist the Service’s IP (as listed on the registration page);\n• manage their trading risks independently.\n7.2. The Administrator ensures stable Service operation within technical limits.\n7.3. The User may stop using the Service at any time. Funds remain in the User’s exchange account. To stop trading, simply delete API keys — the Bot will lose access. The deposit balance will be frozen; deposited funds are non-refundable.\n\n8. Liability\n8.1. The User acknowledges and assumes all risks associated with crypto trading.\n8.2. The Administrator is not responsible for any losses incurred by the User while using the Bot.\n8.3. IpotechTrade does not guarantee profit and is not responsible for the performance of exchanges, APIs, or payment systems.\n8.4.

API secrets are encrypted and never shared with third parties unless required by law.\n9.3. The User consents to personal data processing by accepting this Agreement.\n\n10. Dispute Resolution\n10.1. All disputes shall be resolved through negotiation.\n10.2. If no settlement is reached, disputes are subject to the court at the Administrator’s place of registration.\n\n11. Final Provisions\n11.1.
